# 100 Days of Web Design

## Day 3 - Petite Vue

Today I did another [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) project. The project I did was [FAQ Accordion page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). This project involved me creating a list of elements that can each drop down to reveal the answer to the question.

### What is Petite Vue

[Petite Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) is a lightweight subset of [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/). It lets you use the Vue syntax and reactivity model in much smaller projects. Petite Vue is meant to be just the bare minimum of what you need to use Vue. Petite Vue is very similar to [Alpine Js](https://alpinejs.dev/), although Petite Vue seems more extensive.

## Final Thoughts

### Will I use Petite Vue again?

Most likely. If I ever work on a project where I want to use Vue but the project is too small to use full Vue, I will use Petite Vue.

### Alpine Js vs Petite Vue

I prefer using Petite Vue over Alpine because Petite Vue is based on Vue whereas Alpine has it's own syntax that I would have to learn and get used to. Either one works great for small projects like this one though.
